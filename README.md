# Ford GoBike System Data Exploration
## by Ajibade Misturah


## Dataset

> The dataset used is of Ford GoBike system data. It is a bike trip data for individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area in February 2019. The Dataset consists of information regarding 183412 bike trips, including its timing, location of the start and end of each trip, duration of trips, user tpes and gender of users. I converted the data types of start_time and end_time to datetime formart. I also change the ids to float data type. After that I removed missing rows. I was also able to derive the weekday as well as duration of trips in minute.


## Summary of Findings

> In the exploration, I found that most trips lasted less than 45 mins and the most common was between 0-10 minutes. The start trip station and end trip station were close to each other. This could be a reason for shorter trips. I also noticed that the users range between 20 -80 years with individuals between 30-40 years old taking most trips. Users are generally more active on week days than on weekends. Male riders also constituted more of the riders than females.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> The suscribers constituted a larger number of users but took shorter trips. This could be because they used this service for work related activities. However. customers were lower than subscribers but took longer trips. This could be beacuse te app was used for leisure activities
